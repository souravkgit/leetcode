## 🚀 How to Contribute

### Two-Stage PR Review Process

Our repository uses an automated validation system followed by maintainer review:

```
PR Submitted
    ↓
[Automated Validation] → Must Pass ✅
├─ Directory/file naming
├─ Code quality checks
├─ README validation
└─ Security scanning
    ↓
[Maintainer Review] → Must Approve 👤
├─ Algorithm correctness
├─ Solution quality
└─ Code review feedback
    ↓
PR Merged ✨
```

**Important**: Your PR must pass automated validation (Stage 1) before a maintainer will review it (Stage 2).

### Contribution Steps

1. **Fork the repository** and create a new branch for your solution
2. **Create a problem directory** with the format: `XXXX-Problem-Name/`
3. **Add your solution** following the [Solution Template](#solution-template)
4. **Update the README** with your problem details in the solutions table
5. **Submit a Pull Request** with a descriptive title
6. **Wait for automated validation** to pass
7. **Address any feedback** from maintainer review
8. **Merge** once approved

### Solution Template

Each solution file should follow this structure:

```python
"""
Author: [Your Name/GitHub Username]
Date: [Date of submission]
Problem: [Problem Name] (https://leetcode.com/problems/[problem-slug]/)
Difficulty: [Easy/Medium/Hard]
Tags: [tag1, tag2, tag3]

Problem Description:
[Brief description of what the problem asks]

Approach:
[Explain the algorithm/approach used]

Time Complexity: O(...)
Space Complexity: O(...)
"""

# [Solution Code Here]

def solution_function(parameters):
    """
    Brief description of what this function does.
    
    Args:
        parameters: Description of parameters
        
    Returns:
        Description of return value
    """
    # Implementation
    pass


# Example usage / Test cases
if __name__ == "__main__":
    # Test case 1
    result = solution_function(...)
    assert result == expected_value
```

### Guidelines for Contributions
